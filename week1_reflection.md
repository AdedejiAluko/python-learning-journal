# Week 1 Reflections

This week, I delved into the fundamentals of Python from a more advanced perspective. Even though I'm familiar with basic syntax, I'm discovering that there's a lot more depth to explore!

## Key Takeaways

- **Data Structures**  
  I revisited lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, paying closer attention to how each performs under different operations. It’s fascinating how choosing the right data structure can significantly impact program efficiency.

- **Algorithms**  
  We touched on basic sorting and searching algorithms, learning how these essential processes underlie so many coding problems. I’m starting to see patterns of efficiency in everyday code, which helps in identifying possible optimizations.

- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**  
  Conceptually, ADTs like Stacks and Queues make data handling more intuitive. Implementing them in Python was straightforward, but applying them effectively to real-world problems is where the challenge lies.

## Looking Ahead

- **Optimizing Data Structures:**  
  I want to get more comfortable identifying which data structure best fits a particular problem scenario.
- **Diving Deeper Into Algorithms:**  
  Complex algorithms like graph traversals and dynamic programming are on my radar for the coming weeks.
- **Experimenting with ADTs:**  
  I plan to build out a few small projects featuring custom ADTs to gain hands-on experience.
- **Further Complexity Analysis:**  
  Applying Big O analysis will help me write more efficient, scalable code.

I’m excited to see how these concepts will shape my approach to problem-solving as the course progresses. Each topic ties into advanced Python techniques, setting a solid foundation for even more sophisticated coding projects!
